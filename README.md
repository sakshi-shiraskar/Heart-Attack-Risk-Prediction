# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
This is a Data Analysis project based on predicting the risk of heart attack in a patient by accessing his health parameters like lifestyle and disease states. The project is done using  MySQL and PowerBI.

- *Project Name* – Heart Attack Risk Prediction
- *Created by* – Sakshi Shiraskar
- *Tools used* – MS Excel, PowerBI, MySQL

## **Description**
-	The primary goal of this project is to forecast the likelihood of a heart attack occurring in a patient.
-	The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contained information from more than 8,000 patients, covering approximately 15 distinct health-related 
  parameters.
- Valuable information was extracted by formulating SQL queries, and these findings were subsequently visualized using PowerBI.


## **Methodology**
-	Initially, I began with a comprehensive examination of the dataset and made tool choices for the project.
-	Subsequently, I performed fundamental data cleaning in MS Excel and organized the data into categories based on provided information, such as classifying cholesterol and triglyceride levels as "high," "borderline high," or "normal."
-	I proceeded to formulate business questions and addressed them by employing SQL queries.
-	The findings were later communicated through the utilization of the data visualization tool, PowerBI.

## **Analysis**
-	I grouped my insights into two main categories:
- (i.)	Risk Factors - I identified top 3 factors contributing the maximum to risk of a heart attack and what is the age-wise risk amongst individuals.
- (ii.)	Geographical Factors – I identified the risk of heart attack continent-wise and country-wise.  

## **Key Insights**
-	The three primary risk factors include alcohol consumption, smoking, and elevated cholesterol/triglyceride levels.
-	Individuals between the ages of 21 and 30 face an elevated risk.
-	Risk is more prominent in men when compared to women.
-	In terms of geographical considerations, Asia exhibits the highest incidence of individuals susceptible to heart attacks.
-	Within Asia, South Koreans are at a heightened risk of heart attacks.

## **Outcome**
-	By identifying the risk factors, individuals can introspect their lifestyle and inculcate positive health habits within them.
-Governments would understand that the risk patterns for their country and then take appropriate measures to safeguard their citizens.
-	They could make efforts to educate people about the risk factors and thus subsequently reduce the risk of a heart attack.
